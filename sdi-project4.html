<p>Oh my goodness this was such a challenge! Well I've changed up my story from cooking to shopping. </p>
<p>I was expecting to end up with a longer code when I first looked at the flowchart icons provided however, after 
applying the code it wasn't so bad. My story starts off with looking at credit cards limits, to deciding if I should go shopping. I think of a few friends who I'd like to go with.
Then I think of the stores I'd like to shop at. I'm hoping I managed week three of SDI. </p>
<p>I would like to say, completely off topic, that after finally figuring out how to use the terminal it ending up being my only favorite part of this assignment."</p>
